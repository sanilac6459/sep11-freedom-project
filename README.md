# Welcome to our KeySanity typing game!!! ⌨️

During our junior year of high school, we developed a game to enhance user’s typing skills. We used the p5.js library to design the interface and implemented JavaScript to generate random words, track scores, words per minute (WPM), typed words, and the timer.

### How to play our game:
* There are directions in the welcome page on how to start.
* Once you click the start button, type exactly the displayed word and press enter or return to proceed.
* You have 60 seconds to type as many words as you see on the screen.
* Our game will check and display the typed words based on the user's spelling.

### HAVE FUN!!!
